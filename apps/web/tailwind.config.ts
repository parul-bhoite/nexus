/**
 * The design tokens. This file and `app/globals.css` are the only two places a
 * raw value may appear — everything else composes these names.
 *
 * ## The palette is unchanged; the rules for using it are new
 *
 * The six source values still come from the cut-paper landscape reference, and
 * the scales around them are still tints and shades of those six. What the
 * 2026-09 pass changed is *discipline*, because the audit found the same three
 * failures everywhere:
 *
 * - **Gold had become decoration.** It is the only accent, and an accent that
 *   appears on every card cannot mark the one card that needs attention. It is
 *   now reserved for attention and for the one hero flourish.
 * - **Clay had become permanent.** Six tiles on the dashboard carried a clay
 *   sentence about unconfirmed data *at all times*. A warning that is always on
 *   is not a warning, so clay is now strictly exceptional state.
 * - **Three greys were doing one job.** `ink-400`, `slate-400` and `bone-400`
 *   all appeared as "muted text" at 11–14px and two of the three failed
 *   contrast. There is now one muted step per surface, and each passes.
 *
 * ## Contrast
 *
 * Every foreground step below is checked against the surface it is used on:
 * `ink-500` and darker pass 4.5:1 on white and on `bone-50`; `steel-600` and
 * `clay-600` pass on both. The values that failed the audit are recorded in the
 * comments beside their replacements so the mistake is not made twice.
