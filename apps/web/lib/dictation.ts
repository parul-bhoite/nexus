/**
 * Speaking an answer instead of typing one.
 *
 * Onboarding asks a person to describe their own job in prose — the longest
 * free-text answers in the product, given by people who are often not at a
 * keyboard when they have the answer. Dictation is the cheapest way to make
 * those answers longer and truer, and a longer answer here is the whole input
 * to the Brain.
 *
 * **The browser does the transcription.** `SpeechRecognition` is a platform
 * API: the audio goes wherever the browser sends it, no audio reaches this
 * product's servers, and nothing is recorded to disk. That is the reason to
 * prefer it over uploading a blob to an ASR endpoint — the alternative would
 * put a recording of somebody's voice into a system whose entire premise is
 * that you can see what it stored about you.
 *
 * **It is an accessory, never the only way in.** `supported` is false on
 * Firefox and on any browser without the vendor-prefixed constructor, and the
 * button is simply not rendered there. The textarea is untouched either way, so
 * a failure of this hook costs a person nothing but the microphone.
 *
 * Interim results are surfaced separately from final ones rather than being
 * written into the draft as they arrive. Interim text is rewritten in place by
 * the recogniser as it changes its mind; splicing that into a controlled
 * textarea makes the caret jump and eats anything typed alongside it. Final
 * transcripts are appended once and are stable.
