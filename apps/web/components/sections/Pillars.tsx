/**
 * Three surfaces, not five.
 *
 * The section used to draw one card in navy, one in gold-100, one in clay-100,
 * one in white and one in slate-100 — five fills, carrying no meaning, in a
 * palette whose whole discipline is that colour marks something. A reader
 * cannot help looking for the pattern, and there is none: Growth is gold and
 * Sales is clay for no reason either of them could name.
 *
 * So: `feature` for the two that span two columns, `plain` and `tint` for the
 * rest, alternating. The rhythm that made the bento work is kept; the five-way
 * colour code that made it noisy is not. `gold`, `clay`, `slate` and `steel`
 * still resolve, because `lib/content.ts` names them — they simply resolve to
 * the two neutrals now, which is the whole change.
