          This was two identical tracks scrolling as one 46-second loop. Three
          things were wrong with it, and only the third is a matter of taste:

          1. **WCAG 2.2.2.** Content that moves automatically for more than five
             seconds needs a mechanism to pause it. `pause-on-hover` is not one
             — it is unreachable from a keyboard and meaningless on a touch
             screen, which is most of the traffic a landing page gets.
          2. **You could not read it.** Cards were clipped mid-word at both
             edges at all times, and seeing all seven meant waiting out the
             loop. Seven items is a grid; a carousel is for a list whose length
             you do not control.
          3. It was motion for its own sake on a page that already had
             twenty-seven infinite animations running at once.

          Seven into three columns is 3 + 3 + 1, which leaves two holes — so the
          Chief of Staff, which is the one that reads the other six, spans the
          first row. That tiles exactly and it is also the truthful hierarchy. */}
