/**
 * A horizontal tab rail with a sliding indicator.
 *
 * ## The keyboard contract
 *
 * The director page's rail was a row of buttons. A row of buttons is not a tab
 * list: every tab is a separate tab stop, so reaching the sixth means six
 * presses, and nothing announces "tab 3 of 6" or that a panel is associated
 * with the selection. The WAI pattern is one tab stop for the whole rail plus
 * arrow keys within it, which is what `onKeyDown` implements here — and it is
 * also simply faster for a mouse user's muscle memory, because Home and End
 * work.
 *
 * ## The indicator
 *
 * `layoutId` lets framer-motion move one element between positions rather than
 * cross-fading two, which is what makes the movement read as the *same*
 * indicator travelling. It is a spring rather than a tween because the target
 * can change mid-flight — clicking two tabs quickly — and a tween restarts
 * where a spring redirects.
 *
 * The indicator is behind the label (`-z-10` on the motion element, label
 * relative) so text never animates; only the shape moves.
 *
 * ## Overflow
 *
 * Six tabs with counts do not fit 390px. The rail scrolls horizontally, with
 * the ends masked so a partially visible tab reads as "there is more" rather
 * than as a clipped one. `scroll-snap` is deliberately absent — snapping fights
 * a reader who is flicking through to see what exists.
 *
 * **The mask is conditional, and that is not a refinement.** Applied
 * unconditionally it fades the first and last 8% of the rail whether or not
 * anything overflows — so on a desktop where all six tabs fit, the selected
 * first tab rendered as a navy pill dissolving into the page at its left edge,
 * which reads as a rendering fault rather than as an affordance. The fade now
 * appears on an edge only when there is scrollable content past it, which is
 * also what makes it mean something: it says "there is more this way".
