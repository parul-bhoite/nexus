/**
 * Today — the common surface, and where signing in now lands.
 *
 * **This used to be a redirect.** It read the caller's membership and forwarded
 * them to their own director page, because a department page was the only thing
 * there was to land on. `doc/14` makes the surface common: a founder does not
 * think in departments, and being bounced into one before the product says
 * anything is the tab rail's problem wearing a different hat. The left panel
 * still reaches every director.
 *
 * The one case that survives unchanged is somebody in **no** department. Doc 06
 * §2.3 gives a Viewer company-wide material and no L3 at all, so there is no
 * director to send them to and inventing one would mean putting them in a
 * department nobody assigned. They get the brief — which is scope-composed and
 * will simply be thin — and the explanation below it.
 *
 * ## What the 2026-09 audit changed
 *
 * **The wait has a shape.** `/dashboards/surface` takes twelve to sixteen
 * seconds against Neon, and for all of it this page rendered two lines of plain
 * text on an empty canvas — "Reading what changed…", then "Taking longer than
 * usual". The sentences are good and they are kept; what was missing is any
 * indication of what was coming or how much of it, so the page had no layout to
 * settle into and everything arrived at once by pushing everything else down.
 * It now renders the page's own structure in skeleton, at the sizes the real
 * content will occupy.
 *
 * **A failure can be retried.** The error state was a red box containing the
 * server's sentence and nothing clickable. Retrying meant reloading a page that
 * refetches twenty-five other things.
 *
 * **The order puts the business before the product.** *Where the product is,
 * for you* — the band reporting that 66 of 89 capabilities are not built yet —
 * was the second thing on the page, above every figure. It is honest and it
 * belongs here, but it is a statement about NEXUS rather than about the
 * reader's company, and a dashboard that leads with its own roadmap has told
 * the reader what matters. It moves below the figures, still immediately above
 * the open questions for the reason the original comment gives: its "not built
 * yet" band is what makes "23 more are waiting on us" legible a moment later.
 *
 * **One h1, and one heading step below it.** The page title and every section
 * heading were the same size, so five headings competed and none named the
 * page. `PageHeader` and `Section` own that now.
