/**
 * The first region of the common surface: what was found, ranked by what it cost.
 *
 * ADR 0029, and almost all of the thinking is already server-side. The ranking,
 * the three states and every sentence are decided in `domain/brief.py`, so this
 * file draws and does not judge — a browser that re-sorted, re-worded or
 * re-grouped would be a second opinion about the same data, and the two would
 * drift.
 *
 * **Every state renders something.** The region is never hidden, because a brief
 * that disappeared would let an audit that never ran look like an audit that
 * found nothing (I10). `not_measured` is a different sentence from `all_held`,
 * not a quieter version of it.
 *
 * ## The empty state carries its own way out
 *
 * `not_measured` is the first thing a new workspace sees on its dashboard, and
 * it used to be a card that named its own precondition — "the audit runs once a
 * website is added and crawled" — with nothing to press. The reader then had to
 * go and find where a website is added, which is the single thing the empty
 * state existed to prevent. The server's sentence is unchanged; it now arrives
 * with the control it describes.
 *
 * `all_held` deliberately gets no action. Nothing is wrong, so offering
 * something to do would manufacture a task out of a good result.
 *
 * ## Two tiers, because the data has two
 *
 * Prosoft's eight failures are two at ten points and six at five. A "top three"
 * would cut through the six-way tie arbitrarily, so the cut follows the weights:
 * the heaviest band gets full items, and everything tied below collapses into a
 * chip row that still names each observation. That keeps the whole list on
 * screen without pretending eight things need equal attention.
