/**
 * The brief on screen. ADR 0029.
 *
 * Almost every rule it obeys is enforced server-side in `domain/brief.py`, and
 * that is deliberate — a browser that re-sorted or re-worded would be a second
 * opinion about the same data. What is left for this file is what only the
 * screen can get wrong:
 *
 * - **The region is never absent.** Three states, three renderings; a brief that
 *   returned `null` for "nothing measured" would let an audit that never ran
 *   look like one that found nothing (I10).
 * - **The two tiers follow the weights**, not a fixed count — the cut has to
 *   move when the data does.
 * - **A collapsed item still says what it is.** The first cut showed only the
 *   evidence, and "137 characters" identifies nothing on its own.
