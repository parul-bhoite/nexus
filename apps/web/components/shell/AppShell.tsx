/**
 * The chrome every signed-in surface renders inside: a thin header, a left
 * panel, and one main region.
 *
 * `doc/14` step 1. Three things it is deliberately responsible for, because
 * each was previously duplicated per page or absent:
 *
 * **One fetch of `/api/dashboards`, shared.** Finding #23 is that the dashboard
 * already spends twenty-five to thirty round trips; a shell that fetched the
 * director list while `DirectorPage` fetched it again would make a known
 * problem worse to draw a sidebar. It is read once here and handed down
 * through context, so the page that needs `unanswered_questions` reads the
 * same response the nav was drawn from and the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * **One place that handles an ended session.** Finding F7: a 401 is somebody
 * whose session expired, and the only useful thing to do is send them to sign
 * in *with the page they wanted* so they come back to it. That was written per
 * page; now the shell does it for every page inside it.
 *
 * **The header carries only who and where you are.** The workspace, the entity
 * switcher (ADR 0026) and the account menu. Not a second navigation.
 *
 * ## What the 2026-09 audit changed
 *
 * **The header and the body now share one container.** They did not. The header
 * was full-width with `px-4 sm:px-6`; the body was `max-w-shell mx-auto` with
 * the same padding. At 1440 that put the logo at x=28 and the first nav row at
 * x=120 — two left edges, 92px apart, on the same screen. Both now use
 * `.app-shell`, so there is one.
 *
 * **The workspace is named in the header.** `EntitySwitcher` renders nothing for
 * a single-entity login, which is almost everybody, so the product never said
 * which company you were in. Given that ADR 0026 calls reading one company's
 * figures under another's name the worst failure this product can have, the
 * name belongs on screen at all times — not only when a switcher happens to be
 * there. `WorkspaceMenu` shows it always and becomes a switcher when there is
 * something to switch to.
 *
 * **`/api/auth/workspaces` is fetched here, once.** The audit's network trace
 * showed it four times per page load at six to twelve seconds each. It was
 * called by `EntitySwitcher`, which mounted in the header, and again by
 * `AccountPanel`. It is read once here for the same reason `/api/dashboards`
 * is.
 *
 * **Account is a menu, not a link.** It was a bare underlined text link beside
 * the logo, duplicating the sidebar's own Account row, with no sign-out except
 * on the page it led to.
 *
 * **The mobile drawer is a real dialog.** It was `open ? <div/> : null`: no
 * transition, no close button, no focus trap, no Escape, and a scrim so faint
 * the page behind stayed fully legible. It is now a `Sheet`, which owns all six
 * of those obligations in one place.
 *
 * ## What the shell does not do
 *
 * It does not decide what a page may show. Every scope decision stays in the
 * API: `all.directors` arrives already filtered, so the panel renders what it
 * is given and has no permission logic of its own to drift.
