/**
 * The tools step: which systems this company runs on. The last thing before
 * the Persona and the Company Brain are assembled.
 *
 * **It says "declare", not "connect", because that is what it does.** No OAuth
 * flow exists yet, and `connectable` comes back false for every tool — so the
 * screen asks which systems they use and says plainly that connecting comes
 * later. The alternative was a row of Connect buttons that open nothing, which
 * is the one thing this product cannot afford to ship: the whole claim is that
 * it never states what it cannot support.
 *
 * That does not make the step decorative. What is recorded here is grounding
 * the Brain is built *with* — "deals are in Pipedrive, invoices in Xero" is a
 * fact only this person has — and every declared-but-unconnected tool becomes a
 * named gap with a named unlock, which is a different thing from an empty tile.
 *
 * **It is a screen now, not a card at the end of a transcript.** It used to
 * render under the whole interview, so the one place in onboarding asking for a
 * decision opened with several hundred words of the reader's own history. On
 * its own surface it can do what it is for: show the stack, show what each
 * choice changes, and let somebody scan it.
 *
 * **Selecting is configuring, and the panel is what makes that true.** Ticking
 * a box used to be a write into the dark. The count and the unlock list beside
 * the catalogue update as choices are made, so the screen answers "what does
 * this get me" while the choice is still being made rather than three screens
 * later — and every line in it is a capability the registry already declares,
 * never a finding and never a figure.
 *
 * **Nothing is filtered out.** The catalogue arrives ordered by the departments
 * this company runs, and every tool is still on it: a company with no formal
 * finance function may well run Stripe, and hiding it would be the product
 * deciding it knows their stack better than they do.
 *
 * **The CRMs are grouped, not made exclusive.** Four of them are alternatives
 * to each other, so they are presented under one heading rather than as four
 * unrelated choices — but more than one can be ticked, because a company
 * mid-migration really does run two, and a radio group would force them to lie.
 *
 * **Recommendations add emphasis, they never filter.** `recommendedDepartments`
 * is the Areas of Interest the founder already chose — a fact already on
 * record, not a model's guess — so a tool is "recommended" purely because its
 * department is one of those. The reason sentence names the departments
 * verbatim rather than claiming analysis this screen did not do. Nothing
 * recommended is hidden from the full catalogue below it, and nothing
 * unrecommended is removed from it either: the badge and the "Recommended for
 * you" shelf are a second view onto the same list, never a shorter one.
 *
 * Recommendations are **not** pre-ticked. A box ticked on the founder's behalf
 * is a declaration they did not make — the same objection the rest of this
 * docstring raises about writing into the dark — so "Add all recommended" is
 * one deliberate click, and every individual recommended tool still toggles
 * on its own.
