/**
 * The motion on the onboarding screen, in two pieces.
 *
 * It started as one large blurred disc fixed behind the transcript, with a
 * rotating dashed ring around it. Two things were wrong with that and both are
 * visible in a screenshot: at 42rem it was a 672px circle centred on the
 * viewport, so on the boot screen — which has nothing else on it — the entire
 * page was one soft blob; and a dashed ring slowly rotating behind body text
 * reads as a loading spinner that forgot to stop, which is decoration drawing
 * attention to itself rather than to the conversation.
 *
 * So: a **wash** with no discernible edge, and a **mark** small enough to be
 * looked at deliberately. The wash is atmosphere and says nothing. The mark
 * carries the state, at a size where its detail is legible instead of blurred
 * into a gradient.
 *
 * Both are `aria-hidden`. Every state either shows is also written in words
 * elsewhere on the screen — `globals.css` collapses animations to one iteration
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and neither of these may be the only signal.
