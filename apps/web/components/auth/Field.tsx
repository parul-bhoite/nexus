   * constraint check, and a screen reader announced an optional field where the
   * form would refuse without it.
   *
   * `required` sets both, because `aria-required` and the native attribute are
   * not interchangeable: the attribute is what a screen reader reads, and
   * `aria-required` says the same thing to assistive technology. **Neither
   * blocks a submit here** (F-24) — every form that uses `Field` also sets
   * `noValidate`, which turns off the browser's own constraint validation
   * entirely, `required` included. That is deliberate: `noValidate` is what
   * lets a form show its own styled, announced error instead of the browser's
   * native bubble — but it means `required` is decorative unless the form's
   * own `onSubmit` checks the field itself. Every consumer of `Field` does
   * that validation in its `onSubmit`, the same pattern `LoginForm` uses.
   *
   * Optional fields say so in their **label** — "Phone (optional)" — which is
   * the existing convention here, so this is the inverse of it and not a second
   * way of saying the same thing.

   * implementation. A `SelectField` copy would be a second place for the
   * describedby bug this component's comment documents.
   *
   * `placeholder` becomes the empty first option, which is how a `<select>`
   * expresses "nothing chosen" — an optional field has to be able to stay
