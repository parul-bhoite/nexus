"""The seven director pages, and where a person lands.

Placeholders in the honest sense: the shell, the offering list and every
capability-to-source mapping are real and come from doc 05, and **no tile
carries a value**, because none has been computed yet. M8 and M9 fill them in
through `calculators/`, which is pure.

Two boundaries are enforced here rather than in the UI, and both are doc 06:

- **§2.3** — a caller reaching a department they do not hold gets a 404, via
  `enforce_department`. Not 403: *"this exists and you may not have it"* is an
  existence disclosure about how the company is organised.
- **§2.4** — the Chief of Staff page is Owner and Executive only, so a
  Department Manager's portal is six directors rather than seven. That cost is
  acknowledged in the document and is not softened here.

The list endpoint returns only the directors the caller may open. It does not
return the others marked "locked", and it carries no count of what was removed —
doc 06 §4.5, the same rule `filter_records` follows.

    them, so claiming them would change the state of tiles nobody has verified.
    That is the same failure the empty set existed to avoid, arrived at from the
    other direction.

    **`OPS_LAYER` is the odd one, and the test for it is adoption.** Every other
    source is present when we successfully read somebody else's system; this one
    is present when the customer has typed something into ours. So the honest
    check is `observed.ops is not None` — rows exist — and never "the `/ops`
    route is mounted", which is the `DOCUMENTS` mistake this docstring already
    refuses. It is also why these are the first capabilities that can reach
    `live`: there is no further thing to connect. `live` still does not claim
    the record is *complete* — that is `doc/15` D29, and the count figure says
    "recorded" in its own label until D29 has an answer.

    `DOCUMENTS` and `LANGUAGE_MODEL` are absent too, and both are decisions.
    The honest test for documents is `retrieval.chunks.count(db, scope) > 0`,
    which is **per-caller** — an Owner and a Contributor in one workspace would
    get different tile states, correct under I2/I3 but a thing that deserves
    its own slice. A model *key* being set is not a model being read, and
    nothing on the dashboard path reads one until narration lands; claiming it
    now would let `brand_intelligence` reach `live` and so claim the voice
    analysis its name promises, which `score_brand` does not do.

    Every CONNECTOR-origin source stays absent until M10's integration
    registry. `DATAFORSEO` stays absent under D2, and that is what keeps
    `seo_gaps` honestly `partial` rather than accidentally `live`.

    Widening this is safer than it looks, and `test_capability_registry.py`
    asserts why: `state_from_sources` short-circuits on `not reachable` before
    it reads `connected` at all, so a new source can only affect capabilities
