"""What a workspace would be charged, and whether it is entitled today.

The Payment step of onboarding. Two things live here:

- `quote_for` builds the bill from a workspace's own facts — its selected
  departments (`app/domain/departments.py`) and its declared tools
  (`app/domain/connections.py`) — priced against the `price` reference table
  migration 0042 created. **Every amount comes from that table.** I1 forbids a
  figure computed or guessed inside this module; a missing or inactive price
  is surfaced as `unavailable`, never silently substituted with zero (I10).
- `entitlement_for` reads the latest `onboarding_subscription` row and answers
  one question: can this workspace use the product today.

Neither function decides *whether* a workspace may read or write — that is
`app/routes/billing.py`'s job, via `CurrentScope`. This module is pure
computation and queries, the same split `service.py` keeps from `router.py`
everywhere else in this codebase.
