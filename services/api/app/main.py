        entry by timestamp. And it must carry **nothing else**: an error body is
        the one place a stack trace reaches an unauthenticated stranger, and in
        this product an exception message can name a customer's file, column or
        table. `exc` is therefore logged and never rendered.

        `format_exc_info`, which is the processor that would otherwise drop it.
