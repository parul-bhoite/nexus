"""Rate limiting the credential endpoints, without becoming an oracle.

D14, answered in `doc/11` §5.2: **per-IP and per-email counters, exponential
backoff rather than a lock, and an identical 401 in every case with the delay
applied silently.**

Every clause of that is load-bearing, and the third is the one this file exists
to defend. The obvious implementation — a `429` with `Retry-After` once an
address has been guessed at too often — is worse than no limit at all for the
property M1 spent its effort on: a `429` keyed by email is a **confirmation that
the address has an account**, available to anyone, for the price of a handful of
requests. It would undo account-enumeration resistance in the act of adding
security.

So the contract asserted below is narrow and absolute: **a caller can tell they
are being slowed down, and cannot tell whose account they are slowing down
against.** The status, the body and the headers are identical for a real address
and an invented one, at every point in the backoff curve.

The lock was rejected for a different reason, recorded in `DECISIONS-REQUIRED.md`
D14: a per-account lock is a denial-of-service vector against a named user.
Anyone who knows an Owner's address could hold them out of their own workspace
during an incident, which is when they need it most.

    delay, and timing assertions in CI are how a suite becomes flaky.

    **And the first version of that assertion was still time-dependent**, which
    is worth stating because the docstring above claimed it was not. It read
    `max(hits) >= 6` over the matching buckets, and `_window_start` floors a
    bucket to the hour — so six attempts that straddle an hour boundary land in
    two rows and neither one reaches six. It failed once at `13:59:38 → 14:00:23`
    inside an 86-minute run, having passed every run before it.

    `rate_limit` documents the 2x-across-a-boundary behaviour as accepted, so
    the split is the product working as designed. Summing instead of maxing is
    exact here because `a_fresh_address` means the `login_email` rows belong to
