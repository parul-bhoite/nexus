"""Narration end to end, against Neon, through the application.

**This file is slice 2's acceptance test**, and the case it exists for is the
last one: a stored sentence must stop being served the moment the figure beside
it changes. Every other test in the slice can pass while that is broken, because
the staleness rule only fires when the query, the comparison and the recompute
are all wired together — which is exactly the seam a unit test cannot reach.

Driven with `ScriptedProvider` so it needs no API key, except where the point is
that no key is a supported state.

Two things here are deliberately awkward and both earn it:

**The committed row is re-read on a *new connection*.** `narrate` does not
commit and `ledger.record` does not commit; `scoped_connection`'s
`session.begin()` commits on clean exit, and the route relies on that. Reading
the row back on the same session would prove the INSERT ran, not that anybody
else will ever see it — the single most likely way this slice ships
broken-but-green.

**The figure is changed by superseding `page_signals` directly.** Re-crawling
through the application would be a second model call and a live fetch; what is
under test is the comparison, not the crawler.
