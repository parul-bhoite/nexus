"""Who sees what on the common surface.

ADR 0029 makes the morning brief **scope-composed from day one**, and this is
the file that holds it to that. The reasoning is worth restating, because the
guard looks unnecessary today and will be load-bearing without any code change
marking the moment:

Everything the brief can currently report comes from `page_signals` — the
company's own public website, which every member may see. So a workspace-wide
composition would pass every test that exists. The day a Finance capability
produces a finding, that same composition puts an L3 figure at the top of every
contributor's dashboard, and nothing in the diff says so. The narration
read-back had exactly this shape and needed two written-down properties to stay
honest; this one is scoped instead, which is cheaper and does not rely on
anybody reading a docstring.

The second thing asserted here is agreement: the brief must not surface a
finding from a department the left panel does not list. Two different filters
for one visibility question is how a nav and a page start disagreeing, and the
disagreement is a disclosure.

Hermetic, in `test_dashboard_scope.py`'s shape — the lattice, with no database.
