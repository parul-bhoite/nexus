"""Who may ask for a sentence, and about what.

`POST /dashboards/{department}/narrate` is the **only route in this codebase
that takes a capability id from the caller**, and that is the whole reason this
file exists. Every other surface derives the capability from the path or from
the registry; this one is handed one, and `answer.narrate` does
`BY_ID[capability_id]` with a bare `KeyError` on a miss.

So the id is checked six ways before `narrate` sees it, and the one that would
otherwise be a real hole is the department check: `enforce_department` proved
the caller may open **Marketing**, and a body naming `finance.runway_alert`
would then be narrated under that permission.

Hermetic, in `test_dashboard_scope.py`'s shape: these assert the lattice and
have no database. What a narration *costs* and what it *stores* is
`test_narration_endpoint_db.py`.
