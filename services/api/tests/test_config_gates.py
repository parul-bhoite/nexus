"""The configuration gates, which until Phase 1 gated nothing.

`_required_in_deployed_envs` was declared as a validator over the three secrets,
documented as *"strict everywhere else"*, and had the body `return v`. It
enforced nothing while presenting as a security control, which is worse than its
absence: absence is visible.

Two failures came out of that, and they compound. `env` defaulted to `local`,
and `is_local` also answered true for `ci` — so a deployment that simply forgot
`NEXUS_ENV` served `/docs` and `/openapi.json` publicly and set `secure=False`
on both the session and the CSRF cookie, over the internet, on a product holding
company financials. Nothing failed. Nothing logged.

`_env_file=None` appears throughout. `Settings` reads the repository's `.env`,
which supplies `NEXUS_ENV=local`, so a test that merely unsets the variable is
not testing a missing variable — it is testing the fallback. Production has no
`.env`, and that is the case worth proving.
