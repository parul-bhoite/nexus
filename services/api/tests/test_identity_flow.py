"""Phase 3 — identity: delivery, reset, and one company per person.

Three properties, and all three are the kind that pass by accident if you assert
the happy path only:

1. **Registering actually sends something.** `send_verification` existed with
   zero callers for two milestones, so `email_verified_at` could never be set
   and the EMAIL domain-verification method was structurally dead. A test that
   only checks the 201 would not have noticed for a third.
2. **Password reset tells an attacker nothing.** Not "returns a vague message" —
   *byte-identical* responses for a real and a fake address, and no timing
   asymmetry from the send.
3. **One person belongs to one company.** `doc/11` §3.2. Enforced where the
   write happens, not at the routes that call it, so there is one place to
   attack and one place to audit.
