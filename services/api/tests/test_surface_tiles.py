"""The same tile, on two surfaces, saying the same thing.

`doc/14` step 7's acceptance test. Moving the measured tiles onto the common
surface changes **where** a founder reads a number and must not change **what**
it says — and the way that breaks is not a crash. It is two renderings of one
figure that agree today, drift when somebody edits one, and are individually
plausible on both screens.

`figure_out` and `narration_out` were closures inside the director handler. They
are module level now and shared, so the guarantee is structural rather than
maintained by attention; these tests are what would notice if a second copy
appeared.

Against a real database, because the figure comes from a crawl and the narration
from `generation`. A hermetic version of this file would assert that two calls
to the same function return the same value, which proves nothing about the
thing at risk.
