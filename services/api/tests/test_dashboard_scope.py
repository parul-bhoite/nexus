"""Who lands where, who may open which director, and what a tile may say.

Doc 07 M4's validation step is *"log in as each role and confirm the surface
matches doc 06 §2.3"*. These are that, for the seven director pages: a Sales
manager cannot open Finance, a Department Manager's portal is six directors
rather than seven, and the list of what they cannot open carries no count.

The last group is about honesty rather than access. Doc 04 §6 rule 1 — *"every
locked tile states its unlock… the tile is a call to action, not a failure"* —
and I10, never a zero. A placeholder dashboard is exactly where both get broken,
because a tile with nothing behind it is the easiest place to put a plausible
