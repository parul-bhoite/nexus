"""Who may ask, and what they learn when they may not. `doc/20` A8.

Two halves, split by what each claim needs.

**The gates are hermetic**, in `test_dashboard_narration_scope.py`'s shape:
every refusal here happens *before* anything is retrieved or spent, and that is
precisely the claim — a caller who may not ask is refused without a database
round trip, an embedding or a token.

**The successful ask is against real Postgres**, through the app, because an
answer that has not gone through RLS has not gone through the thing that makes
it correct.

The single most important assertion is that the 404s are **byte-identical**.
`dashboards.py`'s standing rule is that *"this exists and you may not have it"*
is itself a disclosure, and an unreleased endpoint is the same shape of secret
as a department somebody does not hold.
